This code was inspired by https://github.com/tuomaskivioja
The youtube vidoe explaing more is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCvI-K0Gp90
File Sorter based on type and pdf content
You have to install PyPDF2 before the code work
you first have your basics sorting into type folders, i.e sort into images etc
but then I go further when coming to pdfs , i get the pdf to be opened and then if any word matches a keyword then it goes into a respective folder.
you coud further imrpove the code to open DOCX and powerpoints etc
Please improve and change as you want.
